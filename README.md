# SUI ![CI](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

SUI is a set of packages which goal to ease development of SUI-based components and web apps, providing:

* Unified stack (and workflow) easily updateable accross all sui based projects.
* Minification of boilerplate. Boilerplate is tedious and copied code. Hardest to update...
* Differents tools and services that solve only one problem each.
* Transparency for developer (changes and improvements have no impact on DX)
* Facilitates tooling development as asumptions can be made on the stack of each package.
