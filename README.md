# SUI (Schibsted User Interface)

Monorepo of SUI packages.

SUI is a set of packages which goal to ease development of sui based components and web packs, providing:
* Unified stack (and workflow) easily updateable accross all sui based projects.
* Minification of boilerplate. Boilerplate is tedious and copied code. Hardest to update...
* Differents tools and services that solve only one problem each.
* Transparency for developer (changes and improvements have no impact on DX)
* Facilitates tooling development as asumptions can be made on the stack of each package.

## Requirements

### Add `./node_modules/.bin/` to your $PATH
Many SUI packages provide a CLI as a service. The binaries are declared in the package.json `bin` key.

To make all npm binaries available in your command line, you should add bin directory to your $PATH:

```sh
$ export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"
```
