# sui-decorators
> Set of ES6 decorators to improve your apps

## Definition
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. The primary benefit of the __Decorator__ pattern is that you can take a rather vanilla object and wrap it in more advanced behaviors.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @schibstedspain/decorators --save
```

## Reference

### Error

Wrapper any function and handle the errors for you:

If the function return a promise:

- When is resolved return [null, resp]
- When is rejected return [err, null]
- When throw an exception return [err, null]

If the function is a sync function:

- When is execute return [null, resp]
- When throw an exception return [err, null]


```javascript
import {inlineError} from '@s-ui/decorators';

class Buzz {
  @inlineError
  method() {
    return Promise.reject(new Error('KO'))
  }

}

const buzz = new Buzz()
const [err, resp] = buzz.method()

console.log(typeof err) // ==> Error
```


### @streamify

Creates a stream of calls to any method of a class. *Dependency of RxJS*

```javascript
import {streamify} from '@s-ui/decorators';

@streamify('greeting', 'greetingAsync')
class Person {
    greeting(name){
        return `Hi ${name}`;
    }

    greetingAsync(name){
        return new Promise( resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100, `Hi ${name}`) );
    }
}

const person = new Person();

person.$.greeting.subscribe(({params, result}) => {
    console.log(`method was called with ${params} and response was "${result}"`); // => method was called with ['Carlos'] and response was "Hi Carlos"
});

person.$.greetingAsync.subscribe(({params, result}) => {
    console.log(`method was called with ${params} and response was "${result}"`); // => method was called with ['Carlos'] and response was "Hi Carlos"
});

person.greeting('Carlos');
person.greetingAsync('Carlos');
```

### @cache

Creates a cache of calls to any method of a class.

```javascript
import {cache} from '@s-ui/decorators';

class Dummy {
  @cache()
  syncRndNumber (num) { return Math.random() }
}
const dummy = new Dummy()

const firstCall = dummy.syncRndNumber()
const secondCall = dummy.syncRndNumber()

// => firstCall === secondCall
```
Dump cache to console if setting to truthy '__dumpCache__' key in localStorage:

```javascript
localStorage.__dumpCache__ = true
```

By default the TTL for the keys in the cache is 500ms, but it can be changed with

```javascript
import {cache} from '@s-ui/decorators';

class Dummy {
  @cache({ttl: 2000})
  syncRndNumber (num) { return Math.random() }
}
```

For this method the cache is 2 seconds

It is possible to set TTL using a string with the format `ttl: 'XXX [second|seconds|minute|minutes|hour|hours]'`,
thus, avoiding writing very large integers

### Options:

* ttl (500ms): Time to life for each cache register

* server (false): If the cache will be used in a NodeJS env. Be careful that could break your server

* algorithm ('lru'): Which algorithm will be used to discard register in the cache when will be full. Can be lru | lfu

* trackTo: Is you pass a host, each 20secds will be send a ping to `${trackTo}/__tracking/cache/event/stats` with a header `x-payload` where there is a object with the stats of hit, miss, env and algorithm

* size (100): How many register can be in the cache before start to remove register.

### How to disable the cache
In some cases we might want to disable the `cache` for certain environment or testing purposes. In that case, we should expose a variable into the global scope as:
```
// For client side
window.__SUI_CACHE_DISABLED__ = true

// Server side
global.__SUI_CACHE_DISABLED__ = true
```
