# sui-ssr

> Plug SSR to you SUI SPA.

SSR can be tought to configure and maintain. SSR handles that for you providing:

- SSRaS Server-Side Rendering as a Service
- Server improvements shared accross projects

## Installation

```sh
npm install @s-ui/ssr --save
```

## Build

Generate a static version of the server w/out dependencies in the server folder.

```
  Usage: sui-ssr-build [options]

  Options:

    -C, --clean    Remove build folder before create a new one
    -V, --verbose  Verbose output
    -h, --help     output usage information
  Description:

  Build a production ready ssr server

  Examples:

    $ sui-ssr build
```

## Archive

Create a zip file with all assets needed to run the server in any infra.

It will, over parameter, make that the express server run over a username and password in a htpasswd way.

```
  Usage: sui-ssr-archive [options]

  Options:

    -C, --clean  Remove previous zip
    -h, --help   output usage information
    -A, --auth <username:password> Will build the express definition under authentication htpassword like.
    -O, --outputFileName <outputFileName> A string that will be used to set the name of the output filename. Keep in mind that the outputFilename will have the next suffix <outputFileName>-sui-ssr.zip
  Description:

  Examples:

    $ sui-ssr archive

    $ sui-ssr archive --outputFileName=myFile // output: myFile-sui-ssr.zip
```

### IMPORTANT!!

If no outputFileName is provided it will pipe the standard output stream `process.stdout`

## Use the ssr output as stream

It uses the stdout stream so you can do things like:

```ssh
  $ sui-ssr archive > ./myFileNameOrWhatever.zip
```

## Hooks

If you want to change the server´s behavior for very specific business operation like handling errors or logging you must use hooks.

To do that define a file `src/hooks.js` which will look as follows:

```
import TYPES from '@s-ui/ssr/hooks-types'

export default {
  [TYPES.LOGGING]: (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(req.url)
    next()
  }
}
```

Here we implement a direct log into the console. Each hook type could be a middleware function or an array of middlewares functions.

You can check which hooks are available in the hooks-types.js file.

There are two default hooks for 404 and 500 errors. both will look for a 404.html or 500.html file in the src folder and show this file. If you dont define this files, you will get a generic error page.

## Config server

If you need it, you will be able to config several aspects of your server. All your customs config must live under "config.sui-ssr" key in the package.json of your SPA.

For example:

```js
"config": {
  "sui-ssr": {
    "forceWWW": "true"
  }
}
```

Configs accepted:

* forceWWW (false): If you set up to true, then when you have a request from `yoursite.com` the server will respond with a 301 to `www.yoursite.com`. But any subdomain in the original request will be respected.

## Dynamic Rendering

If you want to apply this new technique proposal by Google to improve your SEO and your site's performance you have to set up a `DYNAMIC_RENDERING=true` environment variable when you run your the server.

More info about Dynamic Rendering here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering

## Environment variables

You can define environment variables by creating a yml file called `public-env.yml` in your SPA root directory:

```
API_ENDPOINT: https://api.pre.somedomain.com
SOME_OTHER_ENV_VAR: https://pre.somedomain.com/contact
```

- Whatever you add in this file will be available in your context factory as `appConfig.envs` param.
- This file must not contain secrets as it is meant to be available in both server and client side.
- :warning: And of course, this file is not meant to be versioned.

## Use the ssr in a lambda function

If you want, you can use the output of build inside a aws lambda function. To to that we recomend use [UP](https://up.docs.apex.sh)
Maybe you want to use a config like this:

```
{
  "name": "[YOUR APP NAME]",
  "profile": "[YOUR AWS PROFILE]",
  "hooks": {
    "prebuild": "rm ./node || true && wget https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/nodejs-8.9.4/node && chmod a+x ./node",
    "clean": "npx rimraf ./{server,public,node}"
  },
  "stages": {
    "development": {
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=development ./node ./server"
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "hooks": {
        "build": "NODE_ENV=preproduction sui-bundler build -C && sui-ssr build -C"
      },
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=preproduction ./node ./server"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "hooks": {
        "build": "NODE_ENV=production sui-bundler build -C && sui-ssr build -C"
      },
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=production ./node ./server"
      }
    }
  },
  "proxy": {
    "timeout": 5,
    "command": "./node ./server"
  },
  "lambda": {
    "memory": 1024
  }
}
```
