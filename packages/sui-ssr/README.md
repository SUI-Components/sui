# sui-ssr

> Plug SSR to you SUI SPA.

SSR can be tought to configure and maintain. SSR handles that for you providing:

- SSRaaS Server-Side Rendering as a Service
- Server improvements shared accross projects

## Installation

```sh
npm install @s-ui/ssr --save
```

## Build

Generate a static version of the server w/out dependencies in the server folder.

```
  Usage: sui-ssr-build [options]

  Options:

    -C, --clean    Remove build folder before create a new one
    -V, --verbose  Verbose output
    -h, --help     output usage information
  Description:

  Build a production ready ssr server

  Examples:

    $ sui-ssr build
```

## Archive

Create a zip file with all assets needed to run the server in any infra.

It will, over parameter, make that the express server run over a username and password in a htpasswd way.

```
  Usage: sui-ssr-archive [options]

  Options:

    -C, --clean  Remove previous zip
    -h, --help   output usage information
    -A, --auth <username:password> Will build the express definition under authentication htpassword like.
    -O, --outputFileName <outputFileName> A string that will be used to set the name of the output filename. Keep in mind that the outputFilename will have the next suffix <outputFileName>-sui-ssr.zip
  Description:

  Examples:

    $ sui-ssr archive

    $ sui-ssr archive --outputFileName=myFile // output: myFile-sui-ssr.zip
```

### IMPORTANT!!

If no outputFileName is provided it will pipe the standard output stream `process.stdout`

## Release

If you want release your server to a branch (generate a clean package-lock file and tag) you can use this command:

```
$ npx sui-ssr release --email bot@email.com --name BotName
```

To use this command you have to define a `GH_TOKEN` env var in your CI server. This token must be associate to the user and email passing by flags to the command

Example of a `.travis.yml`:

- Avoid jobs for branch with the format `vX.Y.Z`
- Avoid execute the release job if the commit has a tag associated
- Avoid execute the deploy jobs if the commit has not a tag associated
- Avoid a global install

```yml
sudo: required

language: node_js

dist: xenial

node_js:
  - "10"

before_install:
  - npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken $NPM_TOKEN

install:
  - true

branches:
  except:
    - /^v\d+\.\d+\.0$/

jobs:
  include:
    - stage: release
      if: branch = master AND NOT type = pull_request
      env: NODE_ENV=production
      before_install:
        - set -e
        - "if [ ! -z $(git tag --points-at $TRAVIS_COMMIT) ]; then travis_terminate; fi"
      script:
        - npx @s-ui/ssr release --email srv.scms.jarvis@schibsted.com --name J.A.R.V.I.S
    - stage: deploy
      if: branch = master AND NOT type = pull_request
      env: NODE_ENV=development
      before_install:
        - set -e
        - "if [ -z $(git tag --points-at $TRAVIS_COMMIT) ]; then travis_terminate; fi"
      name: "Deploy dev"
      script:
        - echo "Esto construye $NODE_ENV con la versión $TRAVIS_TAG ($TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE)"
        - npm install surge
        - npm install --only pro
        - npm install --only dev
        - npm run ssr:deploy:development
    - #stage: deploy pro
      env: NODE_ENV=production
      before_install:
        - set -e
        - "if [ -z $(git tag --points-at $TRAVIS_COMMIT) ]; then travis_terminate; fi"
      name: "Deploy pro"
      script:
        - echo "Esto construye $NODE_ENV con la versión $TRAVIS_TAG ($TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE)"
        - npm install surge
        - npm install --only pro
        - npm install --only dev
        - npm run ssr:deploy:production
```

## Use the ssr output as stream

It uses the stdout stream so you can do things like:

```ssh
  $ sui-ssr archive > ./myFileNameOrWhatever.zip
```

## Hooks

If you want to change the server´s behavior for very specific business operation like handling errors or logging you must use hooks.

To do that define a file `src/hooks.js` which will look as follows:

```
import TYPES from '@s-ui/ssr/hooks-types'

export default {
  [TYPES.LOGGING]: (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(req.url)
    next()
  }
}
```

Here we implement a direct log into the console. Each hook type could be a middleware function or an array of middlewares functions.

You can check which hooks are available in the hooks-types.js file.

There are two default hooks for 404 and 500 errors. both will look for a 404.html or 500.html file in the src folder and show this file. If you dont define this files, you will get a generic error page.

## Config server

If you need it, you will be able to config several aspects of your server. All your customs config must live under "config.sui-ssr" key in the package.json of your SPA.

For example:

```js
"config": {
  "sui-ssr": {
    "criticalCSS": true, // or a config object something like {blackListURLs: ["mis-anuncios", "legacy-url\\.(html)?"]}
    "forceWWW": true,
    "dynamicsURLS": ["\/legal/*"]
  }
}
```

Configs accepted:

- **`forceWWW`** (`false`): If you set up to true, then when you have a request from `yoursite.com` the server will respond with a 301 to `www.yoursite.com`. But any subdomain in the original request will be respected.

- **`earlyFlush`** (`true`): Set it to true in favor of TTFB with the potencial risk of returning soft 404s (200 when the page is not found). Set it to false in order to wait for getInitialProps() result (may throw a 404 error or any other error that will be used to define the proper HTTP error code in the response header) before flushing for the first time.

- **`loadSPAOnNotFound`** (`false`): Set it to true in order to read index.html file so that the SPA can handle 404 errors. Set it to false in order to load 404.html instead.

- **`criticalCSS`** (`false`): If you setup this flag to true, you will get this awesome feature for free. More about Critical CSS [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/). You have the posibility of setup several config for fine tuning of this feature.

  - **`criticalCSS.protocol`** (`undefined`): Define the protocol used to make the request to the microservice for generating the Critical CSS.
  - **`criticalCSS.host`** (`undefined`): Define the HOST used to make the request to the microservice for generating the Critical CSS.
  - **`criticalCSS.blackListURLs`** (`undefined`): Array of RegEx of URLs. If some of these URLs match with the current page URL, this feature will be disabled for that page. This is useful to enable CriticalCSS in your site just for a few pages.
  - **`criticalCSS.customHeaders`** (`undefined`): Object containing all the custom headers you want to send to the Critical CSS service in order to make it work without any limitation or regarding any requirement your target URL needs.

- **`dynamicsURLS`** (`[]`): Array of allowed urls in order to make them be rendered dynamically based on the Dynamic Rendering guidelines by Google: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering

- **`useLegacyContext`** (`true`): If you don't want to use the legacy context you have to set this flag to `false`. If you leave it as default, you'll be still using the legacy context but also the new one in order to be able to migrate your code easily.

- **`multiSite`** (`undefined`): Should be an object containing a mapping with an association of hostname (key) and public folder (value) in order to make your server work with more than one public folder. **Important! You must set at least a `default` value to enable this feature.** See one simple example below:
  ```json
  {
    "multiSite": {
      "my-motorcycles.com": "public-motorcycles",
      "my-trucks.com": "public-trucks",
      "default": "public-cars"
    }
  }
  ```
  Once this set is done, if you want to test your server in `localhost` you must run it setting the custom header `'X-Serve-Site'` (with the value of your desired site) to the request. If you're a Google Chrome user, you can achieve it by installing the extension [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj).

- **`serverContentType`** (`undefined`): A valid Content-Type string to be set in response header Content-Type. If not defined, it will use the regular html type with utf-8 charset encoding.

## Dynamic Rendering

If you want to apply this new technique proposal by Google to improve your SEO and your site's performance you have to set up the entry _dynamicsURLS_ in the config of the package json with an array of allowed urls. Each entry in this array must be a string and follow the structure of a RegExp constructor.

More info about Dynamic Rendering here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/dynamic-rendering

## Critical CSS

For development you will need start the server with env vars `CRITICAL_CSS_HOST` and `CRITICAL_CSS_PROTOCOL` to allow to the external service request your current page.

If you have in your package.json the flag `criticalCSS: true` but you want to disable it in development. You can use the env var `DISABLE_CRITICAL_CSS=true` when you start your server.

## Environment variables

You can define environment variables by creating a yml file called `public-env.yml` in your SPA root directory:

```
API_ENDPOINT: https://api.pre.somedomain.com
SOME_OTHER_ENV_VAR: https://pre.somedomain.com/contact
```

- Whatever you add in this file will be available in your context factory as `appConfig.envs` param.
- This file must not contain secrets as it is meant to be available in both server and client side.
- :warning: And of course, this file is not meant to be versioned.

## Server Side Redirects

SUI-SSR allows 301 redirects in server side rendering when combined with SUI-REACT-INITIAL-PROPS.
Check out its [documentation](https://github.com/SUI-Components/sui/tree/master/packages/sui-react-initial-props#response-2) to get detailed information and an implementation example.

## Use the ssr in a lambda function

If you want, you can use the output of build inside a aws lambda function. To to that we recomend use [UP](https://up.docs.apex.sh)
Maybe you want to use a config like this:

```
{
  "name": "[YOUR APP NAME]",
  "profile": "[YOUR AWS PROFILE]",
  "hooks": {
    "prebuild": "rm ./node || true && wget https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/nodejs-8.9.4/node && chmod a+x ./node",
    "clean": "npx rimraf ./{server,public,node}"
  },
  "stages": {
    "development": {
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=development ./node ./server"
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "hooks": {
        "build": "NODE_ENV=preproduction sui-bundler build -C && sui-ssr build -C"
      },
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=preproduction ./node ./server"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "hooks": {
        "build": "NODE_ENV=production sui-bundler build -C && sui-ssr build -C"
      },
      "proxy": {
        "command": "NODE_ENV=production ./node ./server"
      }
    }
  },
  "proxy": {
    "timeout": 5,
    "command": "./node ./server"
  },
  "lambda": {
    "memory": 1024
  }
}
```
