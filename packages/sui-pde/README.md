# sui-pde

> An adapter based tool to handle feature toggles, progressive rollouts and A/B Testing services in our products

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install @s-ui/pde
```

## About

This is a tool that abstracts from:

- PDE tools like Optimizely, Houston, Target, Unleash, ...
- Integration with third party analytics tools like Segment
- User id management
- User consents management
- Common audiences and segments

In order to abstract from progressive delivery and experimentation (PDE) tools like Optimizely, sui-pde provides a JS class which requires an adapter that connects directly to one of those tools. We did implement the Optimizely Full Stack adapter.

## Optimizely adapter

### React context

Setup the tool's own react context in your context factory like this:

```jsx
import {PDE, PdeContext} from '@s-ui/pde'
import OptimizelyAdapter from '@s-ui/pde/lib/adapters/optimizely'

// all options here https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/initialize-sdk-javascript-node, but for now only 3 of them are available
const optimizelyInstance = OptimizelyAdapter.createOptimizelyInstance({
  sdkKey: MY_API_KEY,  // optimizely sdk api key
  options // optional, datafileOptions
  datafile // optional
})

const optimizelyAdapter = new OptimizelyAdapter({
  optimizely: optimizelyInstance,
  userId: // mandatory,
  hasUserConsents  // if false, the user won't be part of the A/B test,
  applicationAttributes: {   // optional, global application attributes that must be send on every experiment activation
    site: 'coches.net',
    environment: 'development'
  }
})

const pde = new PDE({
  adapter: optimizelyAdapter,
  hasUserConsents: true // Kept because of legacy reasons, pass it by the OptimizelyAdapter constructor
})

// app.js
<PdeContext.Provider value={{pde}}>
  // children
</PdeContext.Provider>
```

#### SSR considerations

When client-side rendering, sui-pde will load the datafile saved as `window.__INITIAL_CONTEXT_VALUE__.pde` as initial datafile. Therefore, you'll need to inject the output of the `pde.getInitialContextData()` function in your html when server side rendering.

### Experiments

Given experiment `experimentX` with 2 variations `variationA` and `variationB` render `MyVariationA` or `MyVariationB` component depending on the variation the user has being assigned. Render `MyVariationA` by default

⚠️ If the user did not consent to or if optimizely decides that the user will not be part of the experiment of something goes wrong, `useExperiment` will return as variation value `null`

⚠️ The `useExperiment` hook will send call a global window.analytics.track method with `Experiment Viewed` as event name with the experiment properties so you are able to replicate the experiment in your analytics tool

```js
import {useExperiment} from '@s-ui/pde'

const EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'experimentX'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {variation} = useExperiment({experimentName: EXPERIMENT_NAME})

  if (variation === 'variationB') return <MyVariationB />
  return <MyVariationA>
}
```

**Special cases for useExperiment `Experiment Viewed` track**

Given useExperiment sends `Experiment Viewed` on being executed, some facts could happen:

- Root: Analytics SDK is loaded async and loads after useExperiment hook has been called
- Cause: `Experiment Viewed` won't be sent.

- Root: `Experiment Viewed` should has a different name or properties.
- Cause: Send a track with wrong values.

In order to have a higher controll about that, useExperiment accepts a `trackExperimentViewed` callback to customize it

```js
import {useExperiment} from '@s-ui/pde'

const EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'experimentX'

const trackExperiment = () => {
  window.analytics.track('Experiment Viewed', {
      experimentName,
      variationName,
      customProperty: 'yay'
    })
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {variation} = useExperiment({
    experimentName: EXPERIMENT_NAME,
    trackExperimentViewed: trackExperiment
  })

  if (variation === 'variationB') return <MyVariationB />
  return <MyVariationA>
}
```

#### Attributes

In order to pass by attributes, you'll able to do so by adding the named parameter `attributes` when using the useExperiment hook. Something like this:

```js
import {useExperiment} from '@s-ui/pde'

const EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'experimentX'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {variation} = useExperiment({
    experimentName: EXPERIMENT_NAME,
    attributes: {   // this will send these attributes
      isLoggedIn: true
    }
  })

  if (variation === 'variationB') return <MyVariationB />
  return <MyVariationA>
}
```

⚠️ Remember that common attributes (those attributes that every experiment should send by) are set with the `applicationAttributes` when creating the optimizely adapter. Check out the [react context section](#React-context)

#### Force experiment variation

It's possible to force a variation for our experiment in the browser. For example, lets assume we want to QA a specific variation for our test called `abtest2_recommender` and the test is running in `http://myweb.com`. In order to force a variation you'll have to add a query param using the experiment name but adding `suipde_` as prefix, for example, for our recommender test, the url to open in order to force a variation would be `http://myweb.com?suipde_abtest2_recommender=default`. This would force the default variation. If forced, optimizely impression will not be triggered.

### Feature Flags and Feature Tests

⚠️ user consent do apply to feature flags only when used as feature test

```js
import {useFeature} from '@s-ui/pde'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {isActive} = useFeature('myFeatureKey') // isActive = true when the feature flag is activated

  return <p>The feature 'myFeatureKey' is {isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}</p>
}
```

#### Feature Flags Variables

Returns all feature variables for the specified feature flag

```js
import {useFeature} from '@s-ui/pde'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {isActive, variables} = useFeature('myFeatureKey') // variables = an object with all the feature variables

  return (
    <p>
      The feature 'myFeatureKey' is{' '}
      {isActive ? `active and price value is ${variables.price}` : 'inactive'}
    </p>
  )
}
```

#### Segment integration

By default, segment integration will be active, this means that a global `window.optimizelyClientInstance` reference to the `optimizelyIntance` object passed by to the PDE constructor will be created. In case you want to turn this option off, create the optimizely adapter as follows:

```js
const optimizelyAdapter = new OptimizelyAdapter({
  optimizely: optimizelyInstance,
  userId,
  activeIntegrations: {segment: false}
})
```

#### Attributes

In order to pass by attributes, you'll able to do so by adding the second argument as `attributes` when using the useFeature hook. Something like this:

```js
import {useFeature} from '@s-ui/pde'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {isActive} = useFeature('myFeatureKey', {
    isLoggedIn: true // this second parameter are the attributes
  })

  return <p>The feature 'myFeatureKey' is {isActive ? 'active' : 'inactive'}</p>
}
```

⚠️ Remember that common attributes (those attributes that every experiment should send by) are set with the `applicationAttributes` when creating the optimizely adapter. Check out the [react context section](#React-context)

#### Force feature flag to be on/off

It's slighty different to force a feature flag to be activated or deactivated. Lets assume we have our feature flag `ff_skills_field` running under `http://myweb.com`. In order to force the flag to be on or off you'll have to add a query param using the flag's name but adding `suipde_` as prefix same way we force an experiment, but the only valid values are on or off. For example, in this case, the url to open in order to force would be `http://myweb.com?suipde_ff_skills_field=on`. This would force the feature flag to be on. `http://myweb.com?suipde_ff_skills_field=off` would set the feature flag as off. If forced, optimizely impression will not be triggered.
