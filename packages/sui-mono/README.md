# sui-mono
> Simple CLI for monorepo/multipackage.

Sui-mono is a tool that aims to simplify managment for monorepo/mutlipackage projects but it also works with monopackage projects.

It provides a standard template for commit messages and is able to decide what needs to be released for you
We use ComVer as our versioning system

It provides:
* Commit template
* Release manager (parses commits to publish packages according to their changes)
* Run commands inside each package
* Link all packages that have dependencies between each other

## Usage

### Run command on all packages

You can run a single command on each package of the monorepo

```
$ sui-mono run <command>
$ sui-mono run rm -Rf node_modules
$ sui-mono run npm install
```


### Link

Is you want to link all packages between each other, to ease development:

```
sui-mono link
```

Note that:
* The monorepo will also be linked to the packages it contains if it uses them.
* Packages that are not used locally will not be linked at all



### Commit

You do your normal git workflow, but when commiting you should use:

```
sui-mono commit
```

It will prompt you with questions regarding your changes and will generate a standard commit message for you

### Release

In order to release the steps are:

```
sui-mono check
```

To get a preview of what will be released.

```
sui-mono release
```

To release all the packages

> Your packages must implement script `npm run build` or `npm run prepublish` that will be executed before any release.

> sui-mono only changes a minor for `fix`, `perf` or `feat` and a major when it founds BREAKING CHANGES. Otherwise, nothing will be released

## How to configure your project

First you need to install the `@schibstedspain/sui-mono` package in your project

```
npm i --save-dev @schibstedspain/sui-mono
```

Then, configure your package.json

### Tool configuration

The tool allows you to configure some parts of it, but it also defines a few defaults for convenience.

Here's a full example of the options

```
"private": true,
"config": {
  "sui-mono": {
    "access": "public",
    "packagesFolder": "test/components",
    "deepLevel": 2,
    "customScopes": [
      "cz-config",
      "check",
      "release"
    ]
  },
  "validate-commit-msg": {
    "types": "@schibstedspain/sui-mono/src/types"
  },
}
```

### Private

If you specify that your package is private, it will not get pushed to npm repository

### Access

By default packages will be published as `restricted` in npm. If you want them to be public you will need to set `access` to `public`

### Automatic scopes

We provide a simple tool to automate the way the scopes are retrieved.
If you follow a structure where do you have a main folder and inside this folder you have all the packages (scopes) this configuration will work for you

In order to specify the main folder you need to provide `packagesFolder` by default its value is `src`
By default we check only 1 level inside the main folder, but if you have categories for each package and inside the packages you can configure `deepLevel`


This information will be used for releases and commitizen scopes. If you have a project like this:

```
src/
  i18n/
  users/
  search/
  ...
```

The default options will give you a list of scopes like this one for your commit:

```
i18n
users
search
```

In the case of suistudio, that generates a folder like this one:

```
components/
 ads/
  big/
  small/
 card/
  featured/
  normal/
```

If you set the configuration of your project like this:
```
"packagesFolder": "components"
"deepLevel": 2
```

You will have a list of scopes like this one when performing a commit:

```
ads/big
ads/small
card/featured
card/normal
```

### Manual scopes

There may be cases that you may want to add scopes for informative purposes but not related in any way with the releases

Take in care that this scopes **will not be relevant for the release**, and if you commit to one package that has his own scope, but you use a custom scope, a release will not be generated.
Custom scopes are for a very rare cases and you may not need it most of the times.

Use `customScopes` in this cases like in the example. The scopes will be added to the automatic ones.
